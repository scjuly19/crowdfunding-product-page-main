## My process
I started with creating a basic html structure for the page and then added styling using scss. In styles, first I added the basic styling and then proceeded with writing the media queries for making a responsive layout. And then added the functionality using vanillaJS. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS


### What I learned

I have learned some basic concepts of SCSS. I used mixins,extend and variables in SCSs to avoid writing the styles again and again. Looking forward to learn more and write it with better practices next time!



### Continued development

I will focus on best practices for writing SCSS and modify it as I learn them.
